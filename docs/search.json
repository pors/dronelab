I don’t know anything about drones, and might get bored with the project after a couple of weeks, so better start small."

It can fly indoors, is programmable and has a camera.\nThere is an even better version of it with some extra goodies that might come in handy:\n\nan onboard processor\na matrix display\na distance sensor\n\nSo I bought the DJI RoboMaster TT. TT stands for Tello Talent — basically smart kids coding drones while I was still figuring out crayons.\nLook at that beauty!\n\n\n\nDJI RoboMaster TT"
