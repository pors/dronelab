I like to follow good advice and so I brainstormed a bit with ChatGPT to find interesting intersections between my interests. Some of my favorite activities — like sex, meditation, and reading — didn’t quite lend themselves to computer vision projects. Others had more potential: hiking in nature, coding, learning about new tech."

This app hasn’t been updated for a long time and unfortunately it is useless as it crashes all the time. When the app crashes the drone keeps on hovering in the air, so this first crash is just a software crash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you want to fly the TT or Tello manually I recommend you get the TelloFPV. It’s not free, but doesn’t crash either.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo really enjoy flying the TT manually you can get a controller that is customized for the Tello: the GameSir T1d. I got one and it works out of the box, also with the TelloFPV app.\n\n\n\nBeware of the ceiling effect\nWhile flying the drone around a bit in my office, I went up a bit too high and the drone crashed when it came near the ceiling. This phenomenon even has a name and is called the “ceiling effect.” Basically, the drone gets sucked up to the ceiling because there is not enough air to push down through the propellors.\nOK, time to start the real fun: control the drone with code."

    "title": "Crash the Tello (with and without code)",
    "section": "The Tello Python SDK",
    "text": "The Tello Python SDK\nDJI provides an SDK for the Tello drone that can be used with Python. The SDK can be used to control the drone through its API. The API is fairly basic but supports:\n\nFlight control with takeoff, landing and movement commands\nFlight status information (battery level, height, acceleration, speed)\nStream camera feed\n\nThe Python library we will be using for this SDK is DJITelloPy.\nA couple of useful resources:\n\nSDK 3.0 user guide (includes the API spec).\nRoboMaster Developer Guide (also for RoboMasters on wheels).\nRoboMaster SDK (as provided by DJI).\nDJITelloPy API Reference.\n\nTo give it a try, let’s first install djitellopy:\n\nimport sys\n!{sys.executable} -m pip install djitellopy\n\n\nTake-off, fly, land\nLet’s start with a simple script to take-off, fly, and land the drone.\nTo make this work the computer running the script needs to be connected to the Wifi Access Point the Tello provides. The SSID is of the form TELLO-XXXXXX.\n\nfrom djitellopy import tello\nfrom time import sleep\n\nt = tello.Tello()\nt.connect()\n\nprint(f\"Bat: {t.get_battery()}\")\nprint(f\"Temp: {t.get_temperature()}\")\n\nt.takeoff()\n\n\"\"\"Send RC control via four channels.

My first attempt made the drone crash though: not having the t.send_rc_control(0, 0, 0, 0) command there tells the drone to move sideways (to the right) while landing, with the expected result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe code above was executed in my code editor and the output you see there is the actual output. Similar to a frozen Jupyter notebook. This is possible because this blog is powered by Quarto. If you haven’t tried Quarto, maybe check it out.\n\n\n\n\nUsing router mode\nIt is quite annoying that the computer you are working on is not connected to the Internet while testing the code (it is connected to the wifi of the drone). Every five seconds I MUST check with Claude/ChatGPT if I am doing things right, no?\nFor the original Tello there is nothing we can do about that, but the RoboMaster TT has two wifi connection modes:\n\nDirect connection mode (aka AP mode): this is what we did so far, the Tello provides an access point and the computer connects to that.\nRouter mode (aka STA mode): both the TT and the computer connect to the same wifi router, so we are still online if that router is our home router.\n\nThe TT has an expansion kit that contains a small microprocessor that provides wifi and Bluetooth connectivity: ESP32-D2WD. We will have a look later to see what we can do with it, for now we just use the wifi in router mode. There is a tiny switch on the expansion unit that we can toggle between the two modes. It does involve a couple of other steps though, which are outlined here: Connection examples. It didn’t work for me (there is no QR code I can get from the Tello app), so I will show you what I did:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore continuing, the controller needs to be activated from the Tello app! This happens after the firmware update of this controller. This cost me a couple of days of my life, so next time I’ll RTFM.\n\n\n\nStep 1.\nSet the switch to AP mode first (down).\n\n\nStep 2.\nConnect the PC to the RMTT-xxx network. We are now in direct connection mode, provided by the Wifi on the expansion kit.\n\n\nStep 4:\nRun this script:\n\nimport socket\nimport time\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\n# Environment variables for Wi-Fi credentials just to make it run in a notebook\nos.environ[\"WIFI_SSID\"] = \"MyNetwork\"\nos.environ[\"WIFI_PASSWORD\"] = \"SuperSecret\"\n\nsock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)\nsock.settimeout(5)\n\n\ndef get_wifi_credentials():\n    try:\n        ssid = input(\"Wi-Fi SSID: \")\n        password = getpass.getpass(\"Wi-Fi Password: \")\n    except (EOFError, getpass.GetPassWarning, Exception):\n        # Fall back to environment variables\n        print(\"Interactive input not available. Falling back to environment variables.\")\n        ssid = os.getenv(\"WIFI_SSID\")\n        password = os.getenv(\"WIFI_PASSWORD\")\n\n        if not ssid or not password:\n            raise RuntimeError(\n                \"Missing WIFI_SSID or WIFI_PASSWORD environment variable.\"\n            )\n\n    return ssid, password\n\n\n# Step 1: Enter SDK mode\nsock.sendto(b\"command\", (\"192.168.10.1\", 8889))\ntry:\n    response, _ = sock.recvfrom(1024)\n    print(\"Response 1:\", response)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"No response to command:\", e)\n\ntime.sleep(1)\n\n# Step 2: Send ap command\nssid, password = get_wifi_credentials()\nsock.sendto(b\"ap %s %s\" % (ssid.encode(), password.encode()), (\"192.168.10.1\", 8889))\ntry:\n    response, _ = sock.recvfrom(1024)\n    print(\"Response 2:\", response)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"No response to ap:\", e)\n\n\n\nStep 5:\nToggle the switch to STA mode (up).\n\n\nStep 6:\nConnect the PC to the wifi network you provided in the script above.\n\n\nStep 7:\nFind the IP address that was assigned to the TT (e.g. in your home router admin settings).\n\n\nStep 8:\nUse this IP address every time you connect to the Tello in your code:\n\nt = tello.Tello(host=\"192.168.1.85\") # the IP address from step 7\n\nt.connect()\n\nFrom here on we can connect to the TT and also be connected to the Internet. Yay!\n\n\n\nThanks!\nI want to thank Murtaza Hassan for getting me started through this video: Drone Programming With Python Course."
