Now the drone is out of the box we're gonna take it for a spin (and yes it crashed). First with the phone app, then with code.

## First TT flight

To fly a drone for the first time it is good to have a basic understanding how these quadcopters work, and what the basic movements are:

| Movement | Description                           |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| throttle | increases or decreases the height of the drone by adjusting all propellers equally |
| yaw | turns the drone clockwise or counterclockwise by varying propeller speeds |
| pitch | moves the drone forward or backwards by varying front and back propeller speeds |
| roll | moves the drone left or right by varying left and right propeller speeds |

This video explains very clearly how it works:

The Tello doesn't come with a controller, we control it with the Tello app. I used the Tello app for iPhone. This app hasn't been updated for a long time and unfortunately it is useless as it crashes all the time. When the app crashes the drone keeps on hovering in the air, so this first crash is just a software crash.


::: {.callout-tip}
If you want to fly the TT or Tello manually I recommend you get the [TelloFPV](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tellofpv/id1545864950). It's not free, but doesn't crash either.

To really enjoy flying the TT manually you can get a controller that is customized for the Tello's: the [GameSir T1d](https://gamesir.com/pages/tello-tutorial). I got one and it works out of the box, also with the TelloFPV app.

### Beware of the ceiling effect

While flying the drone around a bit in my office, I went up a bit too high and the drone crashed when it came near the ceiling. This a phenomenon even has a name and is called the “ceiling effect.” Basically the drone gets [sucked up to the ceiling](https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/59128/what-disadvantages-does-flying-a-drone-close-under-a-ceiling-have) because there is not enough air to push down through the propellors.

OK, time to start the real fun: control the drone with code.

## The Tello Python SDK

DJI provides an SDK for the Tello drone that can be used with Python. The SDK can be used to control the drone through its API. The API is fairly basic but supports:

- Flight control with takeoff, landing and movement commands
- Flight status information (battery level, height, acceleration, speed)
- Stream camera feed
- Control flight mode (station mode for wifi connection)@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The most popular Python library for using this SDK is [DJITelloPy](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy).

To use this with Python we first need to install djitellopy:

```{python}
#| label: setup
#| output: false

import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install djitellopy
```



### Take-off, fly, land
 
```{python}
from djitellopy import tello
from time import sleep

# me = tello.Tello() # AP mode
"""me = tello.Tello(host='192.168.1.85') # Stationary/Router mode

me.connect()
print(me.get_battery())
me.takeoff()
me.send_rc_control(0, 50, 0, 0)
sleep(2)
me.send_rc_control(30, 0, 0, 0)
sleep(2)
me.send_rc_control(0, 0, 0, 0)
me.land()"""
```


### Use station mode

@@@tip: activate

### Retrieve video frames


### Control with keyboard
