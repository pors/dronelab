## The path to autonomous flying

@@@ and create a test set!

@@@ other ideas: split out lamp closeups in its own class, use a better model, more data (see chatgpt suggestions https://chatgpt.com/c/682209c4-8378-8011-be8f-0769e8159e9e and https://chatgpt.com/c/6821fb1d-857c-8011-a3b2-cdd77e285a79 and https://chatgpt.com/c/6821f9f6-da74-8011-8bdd-b9eb2904500f).

@@@ test-set model run (from drone shots).

## Try it out on some drone images

## What's next?

@@@ next post: deploy on edge & cool demo. See a lamp => do something. Maybe sequences of images where the lamp comes into view and goes out of view by changing height, turning, coming closer, etc.
