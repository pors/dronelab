## More data needed

While trying to improve my [image classifier](../fly-drone-with-image-classification/), all roads led to one conclusion: more training data needed!

My background is mostly in software development with scripting languages, so my default mode is: type something => get instant gratification. Not so much in machine learning...

Truly profound stuff right there.

And if you think this is the worst, there is also something called data annotation. You know, what we did for free for Google by solving a captcha to get access to a website.

> Every time I realize I need more training data, I panic a little. More data means labeling hundreds of images. OMFG!

I shouldn't complain though, I just heard on a podcast that Fei-Fei Li (the creator of ImageNet) hand-labeled the first version of Caltech-101 which had about 9000 images. But she had help from here mother! [^1]

## Make labeling a bit less painful

My image classifier is a simple binary classifier: is there a lamp hanging from the ceiling or not? I thought I could cheat by using an amazing model to label them for me. I used the SOTA [CLIP model](https://github.com/openai/CLIP){target="_blank"}, which predicts the most relevant text snippet given an image. It seems it hasn't seen many lamps during its training, because it detected only a handful of images having a lamp in it (out of 1300 images).

So it seems that if there is no pre-annotated dataset to work with you have to do the labeling yourself by hand.

In a [Fast.ai Discord](https://discord.com/invite/V4w5ACA8Dj){target="_blank"} channel a user posted a video where he showed the use of a game controller to annotate LLM evals in a notebook. This is the project: [mopad](https://github.com/koaning/mopad){target="_blank"}. Thanks Vincent for inspiring me to use a game controller for this tedious job.

If you have followed along in my journey to ML enlightenment (not likely), you know I own a game controller, and that I created a python package to use it in any Python program: [gamesir_t1d](https://github.com/pors/gamesir_t1d/){target="_blank"}.

Since autonomous drones don't need a controller, and I'm also not a gamer, I'm happy to find some use for it: classify images with a game controller and make it (sort of) fun.

## Introducing classifly

Hacking is way more fun than labeling data, and after a day or two I had built this desktop app that helps me to classify images: [classifly](https://github.com/pors/classifly){target="_blank"}. The fly is because it goes fast, got it? And because drones :)

From the README:

Speed up image labeling with a game controller! ðŸŽ®

Classifly is a fast, gamified image labeling tool designed for binary classification tasks. Navigate through your image dataset using a game controller or keyboard, making the tedious task of labeling images feel more like playing a game.

#### Features

- **Game Controller Support**: Use Xbox, PlayStation, or GameSir controllers for rapid classification
- **Cyberpunk UI**: Neon-themed interface with glowing effects and visual feedback
- **Three-way Classification**: Sort images into two categories plus a "skip/unknown" option
- **Real-time Stats**: Track your progress with live counters, elapsed time, and ETA
- **Undo Support**: Made a mistake? Just press the undo button
- **Keyboard Fallback**: No controller? Use arrow keys
- **Batch Processing**: Handle up to 1000 images per session

## Setting the world record

Time to set a new world record for manually labeling `lamp/no lamp` images. Watch the video below to see how I broke it:

## What's next

After collecting and labeling more images, it's back to training the model. This is the first part of it: [Fly a drone with image classification](../fly-drone-with-image-classification/).
