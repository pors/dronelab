## Fulfilling a dream

As a kid I always wanted to be a pilot (not true, it just makes for a more interesting story), and now I just passed the EASA A1/A3 pilot exam!

Yeah, I know, this is a certification for UAV's. UAV stands for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, where you as a pilot stay on the ground. We can't have it all.

I will need this certification to fly drones outdoors, even the tiny Tello requires the ground-bound pilot to have the authorization to fly drones.

## EASA A1/A3 Exam Practice App

Anyway, to help me study, I (Claude.ai) created a practice app to go over all possible questions for the exam. I thought it might be handy for others so I put it up online here: [EASA A1/A3 exam test app](https://dronelab.dev/easa-exam/). The source code is [here](https://github.com/pors/EASA-exam-practice).

<small>Beware: the source PDF with questions was used as the basis for the app, and the LLM made some mistakes. I think I have corrected most/all of them, but if you want to be sure please double check.</small>
