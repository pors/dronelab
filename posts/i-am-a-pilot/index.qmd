## Fulfilling a dream

As a young kid I always wanted to be a pilot (not true, it just makes for a more interesting story), and now I just passed the EASA A1/A3 pilot exam!

Yeah, this is a certification for UAV's. UAV stands for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, where you as a pilot stay on the ground. We can't have it all.

I will need this certification to fly drones outdoors, even the tiny Tello requires the pilot to have the authorization to fly drones.

Anyway, to study I (Claude.ai) created a study app to go over all possible questions for the exam. I thought it might be handy for others so I put it up online here: [EASA A1/A3 exam test app](@@@). The source code is [here]().

<small>Beware: the source PDF with questions was used as the basis for the app, and the LLM made some mistakes. I think I have corrected most/all of them, but if you want to be sure please double check.</small>
